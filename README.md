## Overview
This is the second challenge I did from the Frontend Mentor website, and unlike my first challenge/project, this was much more of a success.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements
- Front end should be appealing and visually identifiable

## My process
I first setup the body and main elements of my html structure and then edit them with css. This is so that I can create a container in the middle of the app. I then proceeded to add the background image to the background of the app. Next, I made container of the order summary that will contain everything, such as adding the border-radius and the box-shadow of it. Then, I realized that using flexbox would make the process of making everything in the inside of the container much easier. I made sure the whole container had flex-direction column and just went from there. At the end, I made sure to implement the active states of the app.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that flexbox is a very powerful CSS tool that makes structuring your app a much for easy process.

### Continued development

I want to continue to perfect flexbox and also understand grid(which I didn't have to use for this project). I didn't complete understand the properties of centering my app as I was confused that I had to use most of my CSS properties in the "body" CSS class than my "main" CSS class.



### Useful resources
